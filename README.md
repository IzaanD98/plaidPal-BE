PlaidPal-BE is the backend repository for a financial management web app developed using Node.js and Express, with MongoDB as the NoSQL document database. With the help of the Plaid API, PlaidPal-BE provides users access to bank account data such as transaction history, account balances, and account information. The app also utilizes Google oAuth for sign-up and login. PlaidPal-BE is an MVP final project from the Northcoders Bootcamp.
